title: I quit my job. Here's what's next...
description: Leaving my job at AND Digital during a global pandemic to start a startup.
canonical: ''

---
I had been working at [AND Digital](https://and.digital/) for 18 months. A few weeks back I handed in my notice, and Friday 7th August was my last day.

Working at AND was the ideal 'first proper' job after uni. I was referred after meeting someone at a [Startup Weekend ](https://startupweekend.org/)— Krish sold me on the AND lifestyle. The friendly, relaxed vibe really appealed to me. I also loved that I could join as an associate and not have to commit to a developer role (I have a computer science degree but never wanted to 'be a coder').

AND is a digital consultancy. While working at AND, I got to work for some incredible clients: I worked on multiple parts of Avios, the airline loyalty scheme; the James May driving theory app that just launched; Subway; and various secret startups that I can't yet talk about, but which are set to make travelling in a post-COVID world a lot more safe.

I also got to meet some amazing people

Choosing to leave (during a global pandemic!) was a _really_ hard decision. This year has already been tough for personal reasons. 

But I reasoned (with the advice of lots of people at work ...)

I also was tempted to explore part-time or split-working options, but the advice of my former squad lead Simba was to fully commit, else I wouldn't have 'skin in the game.' Being 100% full-time on the new startup gives it the best chance of success — if I hadn't been, and we end up not being successful.

My co-founder has already been succesful in other industries, and I was honoured when he shared his idea with me and asked me to join him as a founder. The idea is really simple, but it's something that I really think has the power to change the world for the better. We've been working hard for the the last two weeks really refining it, honing it down to its minimum viable version, and it's now in an amazing place.

I can't say anything about it just yet, but I genuinely believe it's going to turn into something incredible.
