Quick update — an essay I wrote, looking at links between art, magic and philosophy, was recently published as part of [Volume 1 of *The Neat Review*](https://ultraneat.org).

*The Neat Review* is a magazine/journal that looks at the interdisciplinary links between magic and other domains, and the first volume has some great essays, some great card tricks, and an interview with Derren Brown. Each copy is £30 and you can buy a copy online [here](https://ultraneat.org), or in various bookshops and magazine shops around London.

My essay can be read online [here](https://paavanmagic.com/essay/). If you do read it and have any feedback or ideas, please do send them to me. I'd love to hear them.
