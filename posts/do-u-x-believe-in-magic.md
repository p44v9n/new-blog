Late last year I had the opportunity to give a talk that was an introduction to user experience design, which compared it with magic. While UX and magic may seem quite sound unrelated, I argue there's a lot in common.

There are three areas in particular where both are similar, and where knowledge as a magician can help inform how to create the best experience for users of a digital product. They are:

1. Telling a **story** or having a narrative journey.
2. Controlling and directing **attention**.
3. Giving an experience of **wonder**.

You can watch a full recording of me giving the talk here:

I've given this talk at:

* Design Lab in London in September 2019
* Horizons (AND Digital) in Leeds in October 2019
