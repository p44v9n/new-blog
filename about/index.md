#### Hey! I’m Paavan. I’m a product designer.

In my spare time, I’m a magician, an illustrator, an animator, and someone who really loves gardening.

I graduated from the University of Oxford with a master’s degree in Computer Science and Philosophy. I currently work as a designer at a company called [AND Digital](https://and.digital/).
