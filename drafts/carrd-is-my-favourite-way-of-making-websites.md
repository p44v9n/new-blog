I've been making websites since I was 9 years old.

Back then, all the websites I made were created using a site called freewebs.com. They consisted mostly of dumb secret codes nad lots of embdedded Flash games.

HTML5up 

React Vue Angular haven't kept up

Nwadays web development has changed. Websites can be as powerful as desktop applications (my day job Figma, which is pweored wholly using web technology)

Carrd

Here are the tree main benefits:

1\. Price as main benefit

3\. EASY TO EXPERIMENT

As complicated as you like

landing pages as early validation (hugs for your legs)

3\. Good code. Html5up. Static sites.

bonus 4th: Supporting AJ. Right kind of tech founder. Transparency.

When not to use:

Personal site for a while but blog +_ portfolio (SSG +forestry, staticrypt, link back to website breakdown post)

Semplice or carbon made

E-commerce (siws tried to)
