Around this time last year I was asked to be on the committee for an event called Varsity Trip 2018, as the Design Director. In the following post I explain what I did over the course of year, between February and December 2018.

## What is Varsity Trip

Varsity Trip is the world's largest student snowsports trip. Students from Oxford and Cambrdige go skiing or snowboarding for the week after the first term of the year ends. The first trip was in 1922, meaning that the trip is older than the Winter Olympics, and is rapidly approaching its hundredth anniversary.

In recent years, the trip has been so big that only two ski resorts (Tignes and Val Thorens) fulfil the requirements of: (i) having enough space to fit everyone, (ii) having enough snow in the first week of December to ski, and (iii) being close enough to the UK to get to affordably.

The 2018 trip had over 3000 participants, and the organising committee dealt with something something figure revenue turnover. In tandem with our 9 person student committee, a snowsports company called NUCO handled logistics to do with lessons, accomodation and transport.

## Branding

Because the trip is so big, every student in Oxford and Cambridge already knows about it. This means that the trip undergoes a rebrand every year — it keeps the name 'Varsity Trip', but gets a new logo and style of design.

The previous years had used a vari. You can see these below:

We designed a new logo that kept the motif of having three mountain peaks, and picked a new two-colour palette of a navy blue and burnt orange that made the logo feel much brighter. Feedback from previous years were that the logo hadn't been versatile enough (it gets used in a huge range of printed material, online content and videos and apparel) so I designed multiple versions that could be used flexibly by the whole committee as necessary.

I also created an animated version, making use of the excellent animated typeface League Spartan Animated from Animography.net. This was used in video marketing, the pre and post trip videos, and the VT short film.

In the last ten years, previous committees have used a variety of fonts. These included fonts that had been commissioned (e.g. Bebas VT and Times New Snowman) as well as other free fonts. The 2017 trip used a condensed bold version of Tw Cen MT for headings; I chose to replace this with [League Spartan from The League of Movable Type](?), as it has better kerning, a wider range of letter support, and an animated version. For the body font we used Google's open-source slab serif, Roboto Slab.

We decided that the design for the 2018 trip should be bright and colourful, and 

## Apparel

'Stash' i.e. Varsity Trip branded clothing and merchandise is a huge part of the trip. Around the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, students regularly wear stash representing the colleges and societies they are part of, so we wanted Varsity Trip stash to be something people would be keen to wear regularly. This meant keeping the designs subtle and understated, but also
