title: Trick yourself into starting

At university, I did a joint honours degree in philosophy and computer science, and spent a lot of it really sucking at the computer science part of it. My tutor at the time gave me a wonderful bit of advice, which I’d heard before but never taken to heart. It was that: sucking at something g is the first step at being sorta good at something. Jake the Dog, Adventure Tome.

It sounds like cheesy motivational poster trite but I think it‘s a symptomatic in common with similar to a lot of the most powerful motivation I hear.

Two examples:

Coach Bennett. See you on another starting line. Being a good runner is never about being a fast runner or having perfect form or rubbing x times a week. (Part from the requirement to keep a coaching app generic)

he YouTuber Mike Boyd has an amazing channel where he documents the process of mastering new skills. His _catchphrase_, which starts every video, is: Day 1? Hour 0. Everyone starts somewhere...

In the last few months, I wrote, sold (via crowdfunding) and produced a limited edition book of essays. It's called VANISH. Here's what it looks like:

Before I tell you how I made it, let me preface this by saying that _this isn't a healthy way to write a book._ You know what the healthy option is already: set a routine, sit down regularly and write consistently, every single day for a long period of time.

But the healthy way requires a sense of self-motivation. That's something I find real hard.

So I came up with a way of tricking myself. This is the way for the people who pull all-nighters to get stuff in for 9am.

**The Secret**

Don't start writing your book. (I mean, you've been procrastinating it forever, so why start now?)

Instead, **_sell your book before it's been written._**

How can you sell something that doesn't exist yet? By crowdfunding it!

To crowdfund your book you only need to figure out what you want to write about. You don't have to actually write about any of it.

**What to write about**

If you don't have a book somewhere inside of you, I don't believe you. I'm sure you _must_ have thought about writing a book once.

If you're stuck for ideas, then my trick is to combine two or more niches. A lot of my writing combines magic (which is in itself super niche) with other domains. For instance: magic and design, magic and art, magic and philosophy. There's a ton to be said about any of these just by looking at the similarities and differences, where they overlap and where they diverge.

For VANISH, I wrote about magic, art and philosophy, and linked it all in under the unifying theme of things vanishing.

**My Kickstarter campaign**

My Kickstarter campaign was hugely successful: I reached my funding goal after just 22 hours.

However, the funding goal is sort of arbitrary because you set it yourself.

Before launching the campaign, I worked out the cost of producing each book (assuming a minimum order of 100), plus the costs for the extras I knew I wanted to have, plus the shipping cost. I also factored in Kickstarter's fees and payment processing fees. I then set the price per book so that I had a comfortable profit margin, so if anything went wrong it was covered. For me that was £20, with free shipping in the UK and £5 extra for shipping internationally.

(Shipping prices came out for me at \~£3 in the UK, \~£4.50 to EU countries, and \~£7+ for Canada, America and Australia — for a 300gram book packaged in Royal Mail's 'large letter' envelope size, i.e. a padded Jiffy envelope.)

£20 may sound like a lot for a book. But remember: this book is a magic book (magic books sell at a premium) and it's a limited edition issue.

So I set my funding goal at £750, which I reached in less than a day.

**Limited quantity**

I'd been loosely thinking about VANISH for a while before my Kickstarter campaign, and thought of it more being a set of notes or a zine that would sell at a magic convention, rather than as a book. What really nudged me into putting it on Kickstarter, and deciding t extend it to be a full book, was an initiative called Make100.

Make100 is a challenge to creatives: make 100 of anything, and sell it to backers on Kickstarter.

I'm really grateful for this challenge: it gave me the kick I needed to launch the Kickstarter campaign, and selling 100 copies seemed attainable.

8 days til sold out

in hindsight, offering only 100 copies was bad this was bad

but also it made me do it, Make100, so I guess it was good
