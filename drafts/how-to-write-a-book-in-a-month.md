This isn't an article that works off a routine. 

Regular writing is a better way to do it.

This is the way for the people who pull all-nighters to get stuff in for 9am.

Don't start writing a book.

You've been procrastinating it forever, so why start now?

the secret:

sell your book before its written

yes, I'm talking about crowdfunding.

22 hours til reaching funding

8 days til sold out

KYA - i'd backed a lot of kickstarters already

but didn't expect it to be so successful

How to have a good kickstaret

1 great proposition. a book is easier than a product — coming up with a brand-new life-changing invention that hasn't been created yet is _hard_. Coming up with a unique book idea is even easier.  Coming up with a unique book idea when you don't have to write any of the book is even easier.  My secret was to mash two things which you know a lot about togoether. lots of people have written popular philosophy books  (although its still quite niche). (lots of people have written books on magic theory (even more niche). smash the two together - something super unique, very niche. can really think of one oother example - still a book of essays but less 'art book'

(I use this idea of combining domain knowledge for othe stuff — here's a talk I gave combining ux and magic. .. it helps that  magic is unique and something people can get excited about)
