In the last few months, I wrote, sold (via crowdfunding) and produced a limited edition book of essays. It's called VANISH. Here's what it looks like:

Before I tell you how I made it, let me preface this by saying that _this isn't a healthy way to write a book._ You know what the healthy option is already: set a routine, sit down regularly and write consistently, every single day for a long period of time.

But the healthy way requires a sense of self-motivation. That's something I find real hard.

So I came up with a way of tricking myself. This is the way for the people who pull all-nighters to get stuff in for 9am.

## The Secret

Don't start writing your book. (I mean, you've been procrastinating it forever, so why start now?)

Instead, **_sell your book before it's been written._**

How can you sell something that doesn't exist yet? By crowdfunding it!

To crowdfund your book you only need to figure out what you want to write about. You don't have to actually write about any of it. 

 And then you need a bit of description text, a good looking mockup of what the book might look like, and a short video of yourself talking about it. For the video, my friend Rory gave me a great tip: embrace the budget and stay humble. Don't worry about the production quality. Just film it in a quiet place that has good lighting. By making it clear that you're doing this by yourself, bootstrapped, people will want to help you and will respond better to The Ask. 

## What to write about

If you don't have a book somewhere inside of you, I don't believe you. I'm sure you _must_ have thought about writing a book once.

If you're stuck for ideas, then my trick is to combine two or more niches. A loto of my writing combines magic (which is super niche) with other domains: magic and design, magic and art, magic and philosophy. There's a ton to be said about any of these just by looking at the similarities and differences, where they overlap and where they diverge.

## How to have a successful campaign

yes, I'm talking about crowdfunding.

22 hours til reaching funding

8 days til sold out

KYA - i'd backed a lot of kickstarters already

but didn't expect it to be so successful

How to have a good kickstaret

1 great proposition. a book is easier than a product — coming up with a brand-new life-changing invention that hasn't been created yet is _hard_. Coming up with a unique book idea is even easier.  Coming up with a unique book idea when you don't have to write any of the book is even easier.  My secret was to mash two things which you know a lot about togoether. lots of people have written popular philosophy books  (although its still quite niche). (lots of people have written books on magic theory (even more niche). smash the two together - something super unique, very niche. can really think of one oother example - still a book of essays but less 'art book'

(I use this idea of combining domain knowledge for othe stuff — here's a talk I gave combining ux and magic. .. it helps that  magic is unique and something people can get excited about)

2 brief story, no typos. humble, lean into being indie creator

3 video and imagery. mockups are your friend.

4 get the price right. rewards -- have a thank you reward for 1-2. (i've seen kickstarters which are thank you at 10 and book at 40). doing this for the money.

5 become featured by KS. project we love. all my traffic came from ... how to do this? nail steps 1-4 and you'll be better than 80% of the other campaigns
