_I start writing this before the pandemic. Now that art galleries are starting to open back up, I thought I'd post it. Wear a mask if you go!_

Here's my hack for ending any kind of mental block, whether it's writers block, a technical challenge, or any kind of creative uncertainty: **visit an art gallery**.

(The entrepreneur handbook)

\- design is the most important in a startup

\- fintech: tide v monzo and starling. thesee days its easy to try things, overwhelming amount of adverts, apps and products

\- stand out - generic advice, how to action

\- art galleries good for three reasons

\- 1 mental space allows for creativity

\- 2 steal from the masters (e.g. from centre pompidou) colours not shapes

\- 3 postcards. Only place to get postcards that I know of which aren't touristy and crap. 70p for a stamp, Â£1 for the postcard. Networking. Communication. Show someone you care - physical hand written card in the post. How rare!? Easy to find work address.

Examples of upcoming exhibitions k recc - Palais de Tokyo, infinity rooms, 1 more in NYC
