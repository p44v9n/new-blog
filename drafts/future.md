Coronavirus has done two things: it has magnified existing social crises and has proved that the government can act decisively when the will is there. Millions are only ever one pay packet away from destitution; the self-employed and gig economy workers lack security and basic rights; private tenants are at the mercy of their landlords; our welfare state is woefully inadequate; and many designated “key workers” are [desperately undervalued and badly paid](x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/society/2019/apr/07/second-class-nhs-workers-struggle-as-pay-gap-widens). Who, in good faith, can now blind themselves to these grim truths?
