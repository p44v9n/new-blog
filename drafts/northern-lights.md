Power of writing in His Dark Materials 

Spoiler warning

Daemons are of course a major artefact of the world he creates -- How relateable LYra's world is, that when she experiences children without daemons (and we as the reader experience it) we are equally as frightened and perplexed

Children's book

The strength in Will. Wtch fears him (end of 2) he 'defeats' Iorek (start of 3)

A ton more but these are two strong examples. Neither of these things has strong exposition. But swept into a world, a ftantasy world but which is so realistic (fantasy doesnt mean not being real...) relateable
