One of my favourite questions to ask magicians is what their favourite magic trick is. There's an inherent amibiguity in this question: it could mean either (1) _as a performer,_ what is the best magic trick to perform? Or (2) what is the best magic trick _to watch, as a spectator_.

The first question is widely discussed across blogs, forums and videos that target magicians. Magicians constantly ask each other about their 'everyday carry' or their 'go to set.' Often, this is in the context of rating and recommending commercial tricks which are available to purchase. I don't want to discuss this here — but it's worth pointing out that the best magic trick  to perform is often regarded as one which is the hardest for an audience to figure out. I.e., the 'best' is the 'most fooling'. Is this assumption correct? (Spoilers: probably not.)

I find the second question much more interesting. What is the best magic trick you have watched?

Arguably, if you are a layperson, the answer is uninteresting; most laypeople struggle to remember tricks that they have seen, and if they do, what they remember is just a general outline. Perhaps it involved cards or coins. Perhaps something or someone appeared or disappeared.<sup>2</sup>

When writing this I asked a friend I have known for over ten years what his favourite magic trick was, and what he remembered was the trick 'where I make spectators laugh a lot by distracting them away from the card in my mouth.' He was of course referring to this trick, but what he remembered was the emotion or feeling, rather than the technical details

When asking magicians, however, you get much more interesting responses. Magicians tend to remember all the technical details. They know to look where they aren't meant to look. Part of this is an incentive to try to catch their peers out. Perhaps they are giving notes to a friend, perhaps they are just being a dick.

But often, this means that when a magician loves watching a trick,

in knowing the function of memory, a magician can create lagoons in the spectators’ memories in order to make them forget whatever we wish for the magical effect, or to make them believe they remember things that in reality never existed.

\**What is your ideal magic trick?**

This question can mean two things. It could either mean (1) *as a performer*, what is the ideal magic trick to perform? Or (2) what is your ideal magic trick to watch *as a spectator*.

The first question is widely discussed across blogs, forums and videos that target magicians. They usually ask what each other's ideal trick are in the context of rating and recommending marketed tricks that are available to purchase. I don't want to discuss this here &mdash; but it's worth pointing out that the ideal magic trick to perform is often ranked by being hardest for an audience to figure out. This comes from the assumption that the more fooling that a trick is, the better it is &mdash; which is an assumption I disagree with.

Anyway, I find the second question much more interesting.

Asking what your ideal magic trick is when watching as a spectator will have different answers if you are a layperson or a magician. If you are a layperson, the answer is uninteresting; most laypeople struggle to remember tricks that they have seen, and if they do, what they remember is just a general outline. Perhaps it involved cards or coins. Perhaps something or someone appeared or disappeared.2 When writing this I asked a friend I have known for over ten years what his favourite magic trick was, and what he remembered was the trick 'where I make spectators laugh a lot by distracting them away from the card in my mouth.'

Magicians, however, tend to remember all the technical details. They know to look where they aren't meant to look &mdash; they are incentivised by trying to catch their peers out. But this means that when a magician has a trick they love, one they saw that they thoroughly enjoyed, or that fooled the crap out of them, or both, . This is what I'm interested to hear the answers to.
