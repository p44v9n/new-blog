One of my favourite questions to ask magicians is what their favourite magic trick is. There's an inherent amibiguity in this question: it could mean either (1) *as a performer,* what is the best magic trick to perform? Or (2) what is the best magic trick *to watch, as a spectator*. 

The first question is widely discussed across blogs, forums and videos that target magicians. Magicians constantly ask each other about their 'everyday carry' or their 'go to set.' Often, this is in the context of rating and recommending commercial tricks which are available to purchase. I don't want to discuss this here &mdash; but it's worth pointing out that the best magic trick  to perform is often regarded as one which is the hardest for an audience to figure out. I.e., the 'best' is the 'most fooling'. Is this assumption correct? (Spoilers: probably not.)

Arguably, if you are a layperson, the answer is uninteresting; most laypeople struggle to remember tricks that they have seen, and if they do, what they remember is just a general outline. Perhaps it involved cards or coins. Perhaps something or someone appeared or disappeared.<sup>2</sup>

When writing this I asked a friend I have known for over ten years what his favourite magic trick was, and what he remembered was the trick 'where I make spectators laugh a lot by distracting them away from the card in my mouth.'

When asking magicians, however, you get much more interesting responses. Magicians tend to remember all the technical details. They know to look where they aren't meant to look. Part of this is an incentive to try to catch their peers out. Perhaps they are giving notes to a friend, perhaps they are just being a dick. 

But often, this means that when a magician loves watching a trick,

 in knowing the function of memory, a magician can create lagoons in the spectatorsâ€™ memories in order to make them forget whatever we wish for the magical effect, or to make them believe they remember things that in reality never existed.
