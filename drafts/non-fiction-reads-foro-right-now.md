The following are books I have been reading (or re-reading) recently. None of them were written since the coronavirus pandemic took, so none of them make mention of it. This is good if, like me, you're trying to avoid the relentless barrage of updates and statistics, but want to read something that grasps at and is helpful for dealing with emotions and thoughts you may be going through right now.

### 1. Limbo — Dan Fox

This long-form essay is described as "...a companion for the stuck, the isolated, delayed, stranded and those in the dark." Fox meanders between a wide range of anecdotes and ideas while telling his story of leaving England and sailing around the world on a container ship. It's all pulled together cohesively into a meditation on what it's like to feel stuck, on how a period of feeling lost is sometimes needed. Sometimes, there can be "no growth without stagnancy, no movement without inactivity, and no progress without refusal."

Limbo was [published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo Editions](https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/books/limbo-1) in 2018. You can [read an excerpt here, in the Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/05/02/stuck-in-limbo/). I read this book a while ago, but have come back to it recently, because Fox has recorded and released (in lockdown in March 2020) an abridged and adapted [free audio-book](https://soundcloud.com/danfoxx/sets/dan-fox-limbo) version of it.

### 2. Surrender — Joanna Pocock

Surrender is another Fitzcarraldo book. It covers the author's time spent living in Missoula, Montana. Pocock looks at rewilding experiments and radical environmental movements in the American West. She writes with care and compassion for both nature and for the groups of humans who make different claims about their roles in relation to nature.

Right now, all of humanity is travelling a lot less, which has led to a huge decrease in use of cars and planes. This has subsequently led to an improvement in air quality, to wild animals exploring outside of their habitat, to global carbon emissions plummeting. But the period of lockdown will surely end, and humans will return to travelling the world at speed, without fully contemplating the consequences. Surrender is a great book for contemplating the relationship we have with the world, and questioning the relationship we should have in the future.

Surrender was [published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo Editions](https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/books/surrender) in 2019. You can [read an excerpt here, in Tank magazine.](https://tankmagazine.com/tank/2019/05/surrender/)

### 3. Plot 29 — Allan Jenkins

Those of us fortunate to have access to green spaces are likely spending more and more time outside. Some of us are maybe even taking the time to grow things. 

### 4. The Myth Gap — Alex Evans

I read this wonderful short book by Alex Evans
