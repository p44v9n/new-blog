So you've got an app idea 

In this guide we'll look at how to very quickly create a high-fidelity prototype of an application using Figma.

To follow along, you'll need to have an app design in mind, perhaps as a flowchart and all the screens of the app roughly sketched out on some paper.

Youo'll also need a Figma account. Figma is free to use, and works in your browser. It's a bit like a combination of Sketch and Invision, and also has collabrative editing akin to Google Docs.
