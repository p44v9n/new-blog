* money going down is terrifying. embrace the fear. building for the future.
* Scared of spending money -> luxury of having money
* ... therefore, worth having experts on board
* cut losses quickly as possible -- if something's not working out
* long-term and short-term thinking
* personal referrals are better than online reviews
* be honest (with co-founder)
* lean on friends for emotional support
* stay in touch with hold job
