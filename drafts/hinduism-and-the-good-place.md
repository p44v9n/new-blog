My sister Bansri pointed out a correlation between the character arcs of Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani and Jason in the Good Place, and the four paths (_margas_) to attaining liberation in some branches of Hinduism. Now that the series finale has been out for a while I thought I'd write about it.

If you haven't watched the final episodes of The Good Place, don't read ahead.
