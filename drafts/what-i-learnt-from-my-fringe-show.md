Five years ago this summer I put on a one-man magic show at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. It was called _A Theory of Magic_ and ran for 8 days, for an hour, at a venue called _La Belle Angele._

I applied to do the show on a whim, after finding the application form on Facebook and being egged on by my friend Guy. You apply in January, and the festival takes place over the whole month of August. I didn't expect to get accepted.

I was terrified when I got the offer.

I'd been to the Fringe a few times before, and by then had performed magic professionally (i.e. while being paid) at some parties at university. But I'd never performed, on a stage, with just myself, and never for an hour. The closest I'd done was a 10 minute set at my college bar's open mic night.

The Fringe production company I applied to was the PBH Free Fringe. There's a ton of production companies at the Edinburgh Fringe, and quite a few free ones too, but PBH is the original. The way it works is this: as as performer, _you don't pay anything_. There's no setup fee, no rent for the venue, nothing. And an audience member seeing your show _doesn't pay anything up front._ The show is free to attend, and audiences can choose to donate money after the show.

I think it's a really great model. The venues tend to be spaces in bars, pubs, clubs, churches, hotels, restaurants. In August, any spare room in Edinburgh becomes a performance venue. (I've even been to a show for 10 people in the corner of a bookshop). By hosting an audience, the venue gets extra revenue, for example from drink sales. With no upfront cost, it's great for new performers, as its easy to put on a show. And audiences get to see free shows and pay what they want afterwards.

My daily schedule in Edinburgh when doing the show consisted of flyering for a few hours . Living with Imps. Mental health.

Getting people in / marketing / the art of flyering. Flyering gimmicks. Benefits of location / timing / family-friendly. (My flyer was a postcard and had a map on the back. 

It wasn't a bad show, but it wasn't very good either. Original material How magic shows work 'you did 5 tricks!'

Chris' intro gag, stealing it and changing it. Bucket speech.

Arrogance of being on stage by default - change to humility
