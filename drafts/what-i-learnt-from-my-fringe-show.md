Five years ago this summer I put on a one-man magic show at the Edinburgh Fringe festival.

I applied to do the show on a whim, after finding the application form on Facebook and being egged on by my friend Guy. You apply in January, and the festival takes place over the whole month of August. I didn't expect to get accepted.

I was terrified when I got the offer.

I'd been to the Fringe a few times before, and by then had performed magic a bit at some parties at university and a few open mic nights. But I'd never performed, on a stage, with just myself, and never for an hour.

How magic shows work 'you did 5 tricks!'

Original material

Chris' intro gag, stealing it and changing it. Bucket speech.

Arrogance of being on stage by default - change to humility

Friends are everything
